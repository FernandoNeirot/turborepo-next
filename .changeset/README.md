# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you keep track of changes. This folder is only
meant to be read by those running `changeset`, and you should edit the files in here directly.

You may read the documentation for changesets [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md).
